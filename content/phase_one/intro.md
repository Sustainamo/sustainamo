To be successful, a sustainability strategy must be grounded in a clear understanding of the context in which it will operate.  This means having a clear understanding of:
-	The purpose of the organisation/ event
-	What sustainability means to the organisation
-	Who is impacted by, and impacts, the sustainability of the organisation / event
-	What are the highest priority considerations

In this section we will look at how to do this in three sections.  Initially a ‘discovery’ phase, where the sustainability team (the people responsible for delivering the strategy) will outline the internal and external environment the strategy will exist within.  This will be followed by a process of ‘stakeholder engagement’, where the considerations of the people who affect, and are affected by the organisation/ event will be collected.  Lastly, these findings will be evaluated to create a prioritised list of issues with materially impact the organisation / event from a sustainability perspective.  This entire process is often referred to as a ‘materiality assessment’.
