Thereâ€™s a lot to build. The strategy guide alone is already pushing 10,000 words â€” about the length of an MSc dissertation. And thatâ€™s just one piece of the puzzle.

This isnâ€™t a blog. Itâ€™s a proper, practical resource â€” and that means a lot of content, structure, and community to get it where it needs to be.

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s done, whatâ€™s coming, and where you can jump in.
