About Sustainamo
Welcome to Sustainamo — your open-source hub for practical sustainability.

We’re building a shared library of tools, insights, and real-world strategies to help people and organisations turn sustainability from an idea into action. No fluff. No paywall. Just clear, useful guidance that anyone can use.

It’s designed for changemakers, project leads, policy wonks, event organisers, curious individuals, and anyone trying to do the right thing in a world that makes it hard.

Whether you're starting from scratch or looking to refine your existing approach, Sustainamo gives you the practical know-how to build something that works.

Why Get Involved?
Sustainamo runs on collaboration. If you've ever tried to deliver a sustainability strategy and thought, "Surely someone’s done this before?" — we’re building the place where that someone shares how.

This isn’t just a content project. It’s a movement. The goal is to break down silos, spread practical knowledge, and build a community that supports each other in driving change.

By getting involved, you’ll:

Help shape better strategies and standards

Share lessons from your wins and near-misses

Connect with others doing the work, not just talking about it

Make sustainability more accessible, more open, and more effective

How You Can Help
There are loads of ways to get stuck in:

Share what you know – Tools, checklists, lessons learned, useful diagrams… if it’s helped you, it could help someone else.

Review and improve content – Spot something outdated or unclear? Add your voice.

Build with us – Designers, writers, coders, organisers – this is a work in progress and you’re welcome to shape it.

Spread the word – Share Sustainamo with someone working on a sustainability challenge.

We’re building something useful, together. Come be part of it.
