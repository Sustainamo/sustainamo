# Join the Project!

This is an open-source, community-powered project — and we’d love you to be part of it.

We’re building something ambitious, but it only works if people know it exists. Like Zola said, *“It’s not that the light is lacking, but eyes to see.”* So let’s start there:

---

## 👀 Spread the Word  
Know someone working on sustainability strategy? Or wrangling carbon data? Or figuring out how to actually *do* something meaningful? Share Sustainamo with them.  
Post it. Plug it. Whisper it to a mate in the pub.  
This project grows when people who care find each other.

---

## 💻 Tech & Digital  
We’ve got a working site – but we need help turning it into something solid and scalable.  
Immediate needs:  
- Refactor and clean up the base site  
- Add functionality for commenting and discussion  
- Lay the groundwork for a StackOverflow-style Q&A hub for sustainability implementation challenges  
- Start building a proper community section

If you’re a dev, designer, or digital thinker – we’d love your brain on this.

---

## ✍️ Content & Strategy  
We’re looking for:  
- **Editors and copywriters** to review and refine content, making it clear, accessible and helpful  
- **Information architects** to help structure content and keep things coherent as we grow  
- **Strategists and storytellers** to shape how we talk about this work and bring it to life  

If you like turning chaos into clarity, this bit’s for you.

---

## 🌍 Sustainability & Carbon Experts  
We’re building practical, real-world guidance – and that means we need real-world experience. Whether you’ve:  
- Led a strategy inside an organisation  
- Delivered projects through an agency or consultancy  
- Worked with public sector or third sector clients  
- Built tools, standards, or carbon models  

… your insight matters. Help us define best practice, sense-check the content, and make sure what’s written is actually useful.

---

## 🤝 Credit & Attribution  
All content will be © Sustainamo and shared under a Creative Commons licence (see [Sharing Policy](#)).  
But contributors will absolutely be credited. If you write or shape something, your name goes on it — e.g. *Name, Role, Organisation*.  
This is a living project, so we’ll figure out the finer details of how we show contribution and ownership together.

---

## Other Ways to Help  
Got something else in mind? Want to help with partnerships, outreach, governance, or funding models?  
Brilliant. Get in touch. We’re figuring this out as we go — and we’d rather build it with good people than wait for it to be perfect.

---

📬 [Drop us a message](#contact) if you’re interested — or just start contributing.
Let me know if you want a more formal version for funders or partners, or if you’d like this broken up into separate pages (e.g. “For Developers”, “For Domain Experts” etc).

## 🎨 Design & Branding  
The look and feel of Sustainamo is still pretty raw. We'd love help from designers who can:  
- Develop a more cohesive visual identity  
- Polish or rework the style guide  
- Bring some warmth and clarity to the overall experience  

If you’ve got an eye for detail and a feel for digital design — jump in.
