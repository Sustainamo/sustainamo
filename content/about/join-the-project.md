Sustainamo is open-source and community-powered — and we’d love you to be part of it.

We’re building something ambitious: a shared, practical library of tools, templates, guidance, and support for making sustainability real. But it only works if people know it exists. Like Zola said, *“It’s not that the light is lacking, but eyes to see.”*

So let’s start there.

## 👀 Spread the Word

Know someone working on sustainability strategy? Or wrangling carbon data? Or figuring out how to actually *do* something meaningful?

Share Sustainamo with them.  
Post it. Plug it. Whisper it to a mate in the pub.

This project grows when people who care find each other.

## 💻 Tech & Digital

The site’s live — but it’s early days. We need help making it solid, scalable, and genuinely useful.

Immediate needs:
- Refactor and clean up the base code
- Add commenting and discussion functionality
- Lay the groundwork for a StackOverflow-style Q&A hub
- Start building the community section

If you're a dev, designer, or digital thinker — we’d love your brain on this.

## ✍️ Content & Strategy

We’re looking for people to help shape, polish, and evolve the content.

- **Editors & copywriters** – to keep the tone clear, helpful, and human
- **Information architects** – to organise the content as it grows
- **Strategists & storytellers** – to shape the narrative and get it into the world

If you like turning chaos into clarity, this is your moment.

## 🌍 Sustainability & Carbon Experts

We’re aiming for practical, grounded guidance. That means we need real-world experience.

Whether you’ve:
- Delivered a strategy inside an organisation
- Worked agency-side across different clients
- Built tools, standards, or carbon models
- Operated in the public or third sector

… your insight matters. Help us define best practice, stress-test the content, and make it actually useful.

## 🎨 Design & Branding

The look and feel still need love. We’re after designers who can:
- Develop a more cohesive visual identity
- Refine or rebuild the style guide
- Bring warmth, clarity, and consistency to the whole experience

Got an eye for detail and a sense of what good feels like? Let’s go.

## 🤝 Credit & Attribution

All content is © Sustainamo and distributed under a [Creative Commons licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0) (see [Sharing Policy](#)).

But contributors will absolutely be credited.

If you write or shape something, your name goes on it — e.g.  
**Name, Role, Organisation** (if relevant).

The nature of the project means it's not appropriate for organisations to “sponsor” a section or take ownership of a topic — but if you’re contributing as part of your professional role, it’s completely fine to be credited that way. Fairs fair.

We’ll figure out the finer details of content ownership and attribution together, as the project grows.

## 🔄 Other Ways to Help

Got something else in mind?  
Keen to support with partnerships, outreach, governance, or funding models?

Brilliant. We’re figuring this out as we go — and we’d rather build it with good people than wait for it to be perfect.
