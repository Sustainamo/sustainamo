# Sharing Policy

Sustainamo is open-source and community-powered. We *want* people to use, share, and repurpose what’s here — that’s the point.

The more the content gets used, the more people find it.  
The more people find it, the more they contribute.  
The more they contribute, the better it gets.  
And so it snowballs.

But for that to work, the source has to stay visible.

### What You *Can* Do  
You’re free to:  
- Share content publicly (online, in workshops, in strategy decks, etc.)  
- Use it internally within your organisation  
- Link to it, quote it, and talk about it  

Just make sure to:  
- **Credit Sustainamo** clearly  
- **Link back to the original source**  

---

### What You *Can’t* Do  
- You must not present any Sustainamo content — in part or in full — as your own original material *(unless you actually authored that bit...)*  
- You must not strip the attribution or rebrand it under your organisation  
- If you're adapting or building on the work:  
  - Make it clear it’s based on Sustainamo  
  - Credit it properly  
  - **And feed the improved version back to Sustainamo so others can benefit too**

This isn’t about being precious — it’s about keeping the project alive, visible, and collaborative.
