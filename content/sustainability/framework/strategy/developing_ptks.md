### Creation flow 

Developing sustainability policies is an iterative process, where broad commitments are refined into measurable actions and tracked for accountability.  This is not always a linear process, as some policies, targets or KPIs might already exist, and some tarkets or KPIs might be immediately apparent whilst working on policies, whereas others take time and research to create.  The availability (and outcomes) of baseline data will also help shape your ultimate policies, targets and KPIs.  Adopting an iterative, layered approach can be very beneficial, allowing refinement as feasibility and data insights emerge.

### Creating policies: a step-by-step approach 

To be effective, policies should not be developed in isolation but collaboratively with the teams responsible for implementation in each policy area. This process is iterative, meaning policies will evolve as feasibility, constraints, and baseline data become clearer. 

Best practice is for Sustainability teams to facilitate and support the process, but functional teams to take ownership, as they will be responsible for implementation. This ensures policies are practical, enforceable, and drive real change. 

##### Generating policy ideas  

You will have done a lot of work during the definition of your vision and principles that can be used here.  Using the structure you identified in the preparation phase, work with the relevant teams to review the topics that were identified as important in the materiality assessment and consider how they relate to the vision and the guiding principles.  What actions, restrictions or commitments would be required to apply the principles to the issues?   

For example, if you have the *“Circularity in materials”* principle mentioned earlier, and material analysis found that customers are concerned about food waste, then you may start to develop policies around reducing food waste, using module construction methods for temporary structures, and committing to donate unused office equipment.   

Whiteboarding or interaction sessions can be helpful to drive engagement and generate ideas.  For example, you might write the issues on sticky notes and then group by principle, or, write out the issues on the board and then suggest two or three commitments that would be required to achieve them. 

Do not worry about creating too many ideas or policies, they can be reduced through iterative review and prioritisation as you progress through the process.  As you develop your policies, and work through adding targets and KPIs, the policies will evolve and develop sub-policies.  It is important to strike a balance with policies between being too vague (or weak) to be meaningful, or too strong (or stringent) to be realistic.  A realistic policy will set clear direction, and also acknowledge operational realities (potentially through sub-policies).  

<div class="examplebox">
For example: 

**Weak policy:**  *"We encourage sustainable waste management." *

**Strong policy:** *"Single-use plastics are completely prohibited across all operations."​ *

**Realistic Policy:** *"We will phase out all single-use plastics by 2030”*, with a sub-policies of: *“Between 2025 and 2029 exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis for health and safety or excessive cost grounds”*, and further sub-policies detailing the exemption criteria.
