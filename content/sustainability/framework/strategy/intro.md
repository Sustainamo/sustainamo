### Summary
In the previous phase, we focused on understanding the organisation’s context and stakeholder perspectives to identify the material issues that matter most.  We now turn to strategy and planning, defining how to move things forward in a structured and achievable way.

This phase is about creating a framework for action. It starts with a clear vision, supported by guiding principles, and communicated through a strong narrative: what is important, why it is important, and what we aim to achieve. This not only provides structure, but ensures we can communicate the strategy effectively and engage others in its delivery.  From there, we set objectives, establish ambition, and baseline our data: understanding where we are today so we can set meaningful targets for progress.  Those targets, in turn, shape the policies and approaches needed to drive change over time. 

This isn’t about solving everything at once; it’s about setting a clear direction and creating the conditions for long-term impact.
