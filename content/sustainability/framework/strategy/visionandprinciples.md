A sustainability vision is a clear, compelling statement that encapsulates what sustainability means for your organisation.  It provides direction and helps engage stakeholders by articulating why sustainability matters and what you aim to achieve.  A strong vision is typically accompanied by a set of guiding principles, which expand on the vision by outlining key commitments and ways of working.  These principles ensure that the sustainability efforts remain structured, practical and aligned with organisational priorities.  

Whilst the vision should be short and memorable, it is helpful to prepare a one-page supporting narrative that weaves the vision and principles together.  This document explains their connection, why they are important, and how they will be addressed, whilst illustrating their alignment with the overall organisational objectives.  A key factor in achieving sustainable outcomes is effectively engaging with internal and external stakeholders, and the narrative is a key tool to achieving this.

A sustainability vision is a clear, compelling statement that encapsulates what sustainability means for your organisation.

A key factor in achieving sustainable outcomes is effectively engaging with internal and external stakeholders, and the narrative is a key tool to achieving this.  
### 4.2.2 Who creates the vision?
Creating a vision and guiding principles is an iterative and collaborative process, led by a Sustainability team but shaped by input from across the wider organisation and key stakeholders.  The motivation for creating the strategy, whether compliance, brand positioning, stakeholder/customer expectations, or a broader commitment to sustainability, will influence who is involved and how much input they have.  

The groundwork is largely done through the materiality assessment (Phase 1), where internal and external perspectives help define what is most relevant.  The most effective strategies are those developed with and by the people who will implement them, rather than imposed from a standalone team or function.  A bottom-up approach fosters ownership, ensuring the vision and principles are both meaningful and practicable.

Contributors typically include:

- **Sustainability team**: facilitating the process rather than dictating the outcomes
- **Senior leadership**: ensuring alignment with organisational strategy and securing buy-in / executive sponsorship
- **Operational teams**: providing insight into sustainability opportunities and challenges in day-to-day functions
- **Clients, suppliers and key stakeholders**: offering external perspectives and expectations

Workshops, discussions, and collaborative sessions can help bring these perspectives together and shape a vision which is owned across the organisation rather than imposed from above.
### 4.2.3 When to create the vision?
The vision is established after the materiality assessment (Phase 1), but before defining specific targets, policies and KPIs.   By this stage, the organisation will have gathered valuable insights from internal and external stakeholders, providing a clear understanding of what sustainability means in its specific context.

This stage is not about solving every challenge immediately, but about setting a clear direction.  It is an evolving process; as more detailed targets, policies, and action plans develop, new insights may refine the vision over time.  Even if the organisation starts with a strong initial motivation for creating the strategy, e.g. to be “the most sustainable event” or the “first net-zero furniture company” etc, the process of defining and refining the vision helps clarify what this actually means in practice.
### 4.2.4 Distil your principles as you go
As you embark and progress on the sustainability journey for your organisation or event, you will find certain themes, opportunities, or challenges emerging that are particularly relevant.  These may align with your organisation values, highlight key risks or opportunities, or reflect stakeholder expectations.  Keeping track of these as they arise, can provide a strong start point when you are ready to start work to formally define your vision and guiding principles.  

At its core, sustainability is about minimising negative impacts and delivering positive outcomes for people and planet.  Because sustainability can touch upon every aspect of your operation, it is essential to focus on what is relevant and achievable within your organisational context, rather than trying to tackle everything at once.    

Your vision and principles should define where your sustainability priorities lie.  For example:
- If customer demand is for your organisation to have a more sustainable offering, a guiding principle might be: *‘We will support sustainable experiences by reducing environmental impacts at every customer touchpoint, and providing clearly labelled and accessible, low-impact options’.*
- If transparent sustainability is a core brand issue, then the vision may be: *‘We are committed to sustainability through continuous communication, reporting on resource use, and collaborating with suppliers and customers to drive responsible sourcing’*.

What any given organisation can achieve, and how they go about it, will depend on their specific context and values.  The key is to understand where you are now, and set a direction for meaningful improvement.  The themes and priorities identified so far will provide a solid foundation to shape a clear vision, supported by guiding principles. 
### 4.2.5 Defining your vision and principles
Building on the work to reach this point, you can now begin defining your sustainability vision and guiding principles.  This is an iterative process that moves from broad ideas to a clear, concise statement, with principles expanding on the vision to outline commitments and shape decision making.  

**Step 1: Identify key themes**
- Review findings from discovery, stakeholder engagement, and materiality analysis.
- Identify recurring challenges, risks and opportunities most relevant to sustainability in your organisation.
- Look for points of alignment between sustainability themes, organisational values and business strategy.

**Step 2: Define the focus areas**
- Group the identified themes into 3 – 8 key focus areas that will guide sustainability efforts.
    - Focus areas are broad categories that group issues together (Energy, Carbon, Waste & Circularity, Social Impact etc)
- Ensure these focus areas reflect where the organisation can make the biggest impact while remaining realistic and actionable.
- Ensure focus areas are structured in a way that supports clear reporting and strategic implementation, aligning where possible with existing departments, functional areas, or operational teams.

**Step 3: Draft the Vision Statement**
- The vision should be short, clear, and action oriented.
- It should express what sustainability means for the organisation and the direction it is taking.
- Avoid vague statements, and ensure it provides meaningful direction.
>  Example Vision Statements:
> - *"We will lead the transition to a circular economy by embedding reusability into every stage of our supply chain."*
> - *"Our target is to operate with net-zero impact, reducing emissions and resource use across our operations."*
> - *"We are committed to delivering inclusive, low-impact events that set a new standard for sustainability in our industry."*

**Step 4: Draft the guiding principles**

Once the vision is drafted, define 3 - 6 guiding principles to:
- Shape sustainability decision making, framing, and awareness
- Translate broad commitments into structured action areas.
- Support policy and target development.

Unlike focus areas, guiding principles define how sustainability is applied across the organisation, shaping decisions and actions.

> Examples of guiding principles:
> - Circularity in materials: designing out waste by prioritising reusability, repairability, and recyclability through procurement and product development. 
> - Carbon reduction at every stage: setting measurable carbon reduction targets across energy use, transport, and operations. 
> - Transparency and accountability: using data-driven decision-making and clear reporting frameworks to measure and communicate progress.
> - Collaborative sustainability: partnering with suppliers, customers, and industry groups to drive collective action.

**Step 5: Test and Refine the Vision and principles**
- Share the draft vision and principles with key internal stakeholders and leadership.
- Ensure they resonate with those who will implement them and those affected by them.  
- Revise if needed to improve clarity, alignment, or engagement potential.

**Step 6: Develop a Supporting Narrative**
Once the vision is finalised, create a one-page supporting document that explains:
- Why the vision was chosen.
- How it aligns with organisational targets.
- How it connects to materiality and stakeholder priorities.
- This ensures consistency in messaging and provides a tool for engagement.

### 4.2.6 Crafting your narrative
A well-crafted narrative transforms your vision into a story that resonates and inspires action and engagement:
-	Consider your audience: who needs to hear this story, and why? Tailor your message and presentation approach to resonate with internal teams, external partners, or wider stakeholders.
-	Make it memorable: keep the narrative clear, simple, and aligned with organisational values. A strong, concise message is easier for teams to understand and amplify.
-	Focus on impact: highlight tangible benefits, such as cost savings, reputational gains, or positive environmental outcomes.
-	Support stakeholder engagement: ensure the narrative empowers workstreams to engage their stakeholders effectively.
