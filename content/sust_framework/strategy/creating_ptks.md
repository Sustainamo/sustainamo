### 4.3.1 Summary
Transforming sustainability commitments into measurable progress requires a structured approach to policies, targets, and KPIs.  Without this, sustainability efforts risk being vague, inconsistent, or difficult to implement.  Policies establish clear expectations and accountability; Targets translate policies into action through tangible goals; and KPIs track progress internally, ensuring accountability and measuring performance.

Before beginning to develop policies, targets and KPIs, define the structure you will use, and the roles and responsibilities of those to be involved.  The process is iterative and collaborative, translating the insights from the materiality assessment through the lens of the sustainability vision and guiding principles.  Policies start as broad commitments and become more specific through an iterative process, targets refine the commitments, policies are adjusted or expanded to support those targets, and KPIs establish measurable indicators of progress, with each step informed by operational realities and the available data.

This section will outline how to structure the process effectively, and provides practical guidance on developing a clear, achievable, and enforceable framework.  

### 4.3.2 Preparation: structure and planning
Aligning the process in relation to organisational structures, resources, and priorities helps to streamline implementation, avoid roadblocks, and ensure sustainability efforts lead to positive outcomes.  

***Structuring policy areas***<br>
Define how policies will be grouped, whether by function (e.g., Procurement, Operations, Transport) and/or by specific topics (e.g., Plastics, Energy Use, Waste Management). Consider how policies align with existing teams and responsibilities, ensuring clear accountability and deliverability.  The approach may evolve as you start to identify policies and targets, but an initial firm foundation will greatly help.  

***Assigning Ownership***<br>
For the best outcomes, policies and targets should be embedded through the teams responsible for implementing them, with sustainability teams supporting but not imposing. For example, catering teams should take the lead on food waste reduction, while sustainability teams provide guidance and facilitation. Identify policy owners early and clarify their role.

***Engagement and awareness***<br>
Assess whether teams understand the vision and sustainability commitments. If they were not heavily involved in developing the vision and principles, additional engagement may be needed to ensure alignment and buy-in. Consider whether teams have the necessary knowledge, skills, and resources to contribute meaningfully.

***Timeline and milestones***<br>
Develop a realistic timeline, mapping out which teams need to be involved at each stage, and communicate this in advance. Factor in time for consultation, review, and refinement. Allow for data collection where baseline measurements are not yet available.

***Definition of Done (DoD)***<br>
Define the criteria individual policies, targets and KPIs have to meet to be considered “Done”.  For example, that the team responsible for that area, and the sustainability team are satisfied the policies are comprehensive, and that individual components meet standards for clarity, completeness, feasibility, and ability to be assessed.   

***Data and insights readiness***<br>
Ensure key information from the materiality assessment is available to support policy development. While baseline analysis will take place later, consider what data will need to be gathered and factor this into the timeline.

***Preparing templates***<br>
Standardise formats for policies, targets, and KPIs to streamline the process. Having structured templates helps maintain consistency and ensures policies are clear, actionable, and trackable.

### 4.3.3 Key considerations for policy development
Aligning policies with organisational function
Policies should reflect the unique sustainability challenges and opportunities of an organisation. While all organisations may need policies covering areas like energy, waste, and procurement, the focus and implementation will differ depending on the sector.
For example:

- **A venue** might focus on enabling sustainable choices for attendees, with policies for:
  - Encouraging low-carbon travel and providing public transport incentives.
  - Reducing event waste through clear bin systems and supplier requirements.
  - Sourcing sustainable catering, minimising food waste, and eliminating single-use plastics through service design.
- **A consultancy** might focus on embedding sustainability in its advisory work, with policies for:
  - Ensuring all client recommendations include sustainability considerations.
  - Offering sustainability training to staff and external partners.
  - Reducing emissions from business travel and offsetting unavoidable impacts.
- **A manufacturer** might prioritise operational efficiency and supply chain impact, with policies for:
  - Circular procurement — prioritising materials that are reusable, recycled, or responsibly sourced.
  - Reducing production waste and improving resource efficiency.
  - Phasing out high-impact refrigerants and monitoring emissions across sites.

Policies should not exist in isolation; they should be designed within the operational realities of the organisation (and functional teams) who will implement them. 

### How do you intend to use the policies?
Your policies will define your organisational sustainability approach and ambition, providing not only a practical framework, but potentially an effective communication tool.  Externally they can help set expectations for suppliers and stakeholders through providing a clear reference point for contracts and ways of working.  In addition, they can signal your values, build transparency, and drive engagement with customers, partners, and the wider community.   Sharing policies with suppliers gives them a clear understanding of what is required to align with your requirements and expectations, and facilitates their inclusion in contractual arrangements.  

Internally, policies provide clarity, making it easier for teams to act. A well-structured policy removes ambiguity, ensures consistency, and helps people understand exactly what’s expected of them; moving sustainability from an abstract concept to something they can apply in day-to-day decisions.

It is recommended that organisations treat their policies as a powerful engagement tool, both for internal alignment and external transparency. This could take the form of full policies, select sections, or tailored versions for different audiences.

### Defining policies, targets and KPIs
It is essential to define and use terminology consistently to ensure clarity and alignment.  Some organisations may call targets objectives, or combine policies with targets, or targets with KPIs etc.  Organisations should adopt an approach which aligns with how they already work. The framework presented here is a recommended approach for those starting from scratch:

<div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 2rem auto;">
  <img src="/assets/images/content/sustainability/cptk_definingpolicies.png" alt="diagram showing Importance vs Impact matrix" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

 
#### Use of language
Language in policies should be precise and enforceable. Vague wording can lead to lack of accountability and inconsistent implementation. Consider using structured terminology like the MoSCoW method suggested below:

<div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 2rem auto;">
  <img src="/assets/images/content/cptk_moscow.png" alt="diagram showing Importance vs Impact matrix" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

 
Utilising the same language in contracts and when assessing proposals from suppliers / contractors is helpful, as it provides clear assessment criteria and allows third parties to understand what is expected from them.
