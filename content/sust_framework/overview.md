Sustainability relates to almost every aspect of your organisation or event, so knowing where to start can be daunting.  

<span class="note">something here about the framework / strategy being the most important starting area<span>

However, you can make it a manageable process by following a step-by-step process, and incrementally building out your strategy,
The strategy should, first and foremost, be rooted in your organisation; in what its purpose (or product) is, and in its wider strategy and values.   From here it will build out via a process of determining what is most materially important to your organisation and its stakeholders, and the translation of this into a guiding vision and set of objectives to achieve your definition of sustainability for your organisation. 

A high-level view of the process is shown below:

</div>


In addition, it is helpful to develop a governance framework to support managing the strategy.  Throughout the process, engagement and collaboration will be essential to achieving buy-in and securing positive long-term outcomes.  It is also incredibly beneficial to approach the process with pragmatic mindsight, remembering that ‘perfection can be the enemy of good’.  Sustainability is an iterative process, and it is better to start than to delay whilst seeking perfection.
