This (inevitably?) led to me ordering a star tracker which is due any day now, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to try a timelapse with last nights clear sky as it’s something I’d love to do with a clear milyway sky one night.</p>

<p>The setting was my Dad’s house in France, which, although only one room deep, looks like a classic French chateaux complete with the amazing roof line they have - so I thought a great foreground item.  I definitely have a lot to learn but it was an interesting process and I’m keen to try again soon now I’ve read up on how to do it better.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening, I set the camera up on a tripod looking up at the sky over the house.  I put it in Av mode, with an interval timer set for 45secs.  Around 45 mins before sunset I set it going and checked back in on it periodically.  I noticed at twilight that the stars were visible to the eye, but not appearing in the photos, so I switched it to manual and adjusted the ISO and SS manually so the stars were appearing in the shots.</p>

<p>When I checked back in an hour later (around half nine), the shots were again underexposed so you couldn’t see the stars.  I adjusted the settings again to make the stars visible and left it to it again.  The camera carried on snapping away until around 4:30 when the battery died.</p>

<p>I retrieved the camera and looked at the images in the morning - and then went down a rabbit hole of videos on how to actually make a timelapse on my laptop - and videos about how to get the perfect outcomes from “Holy Grail” timelapses.  This is the name for timelapses which transition day-to-night I’ve learnt.</p>

<div class="markdown-alert markdown-alert-note"><p class="markdown-alert-title"><svg class="octicon octicon-info" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M0 8a8 8 0 1 1 16 0A8 8 0 0 1 0 8Zm8-6.5a6.5 6.5 0 1 0 0 13 6.5 6.5 0 0 0 0-13ZM6.5 7.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.25 7h1a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75v2.75h.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5h-2a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5h.25v-2h-.25a.75.75 0 0 1-.75-.75ZM8 6a1 1 0 1 1 0-2 1 1 0 0 1 0 2Z"></path></svg> Note</p><p>Key learning is next time either just leave in Av mode and let the camera manage the transition and should be okay overall, OR… manually tweak throughout the three stages of twilight, an involved process but will get the best results</p>
</div>

<p>Anyway, I had a go at stitching the stills together in DaVinci Resolve (excellent free video editing software).  I’d used it before for some basic video editing to assumed it could do this, and found a few videos that explained how to do it, though it’s a fairly simple process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>convert .raw files into .dng files (DaVinci’s preferred input) using the free Adobe DNG converter</li>
  <li>drag and drop photos into DaVinci Resolve’s ‘media pool’</li>
  <li>check still duration set to 1 frame (preferences &gt; user &gt; editing) - otherwise it defaults to 5 secs</li>
  <li>that’s it - make tweaks to exposure / brightness / contrast etc of given frames as needed from within DR</li>
</ul>

<p>As DR has some quite powerful frame editing capabilities, I was able to adjust out some of my exposure mistakes, though I didn’t spend too long on it as keen to just take the learnings and try again.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFdRO0RsdMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> was the most useful I found for understanding how to do the timelapse in DR - with some additional information on how to adjust / enhance your timelapse too.</p>

<p>And my first attempt was:</p>

<p><em>Tips for next time</em>
Most complete video I found on timelapses was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgPLOOVvM9k&amp;t=7s" target="_blank">this one</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Be prepared - note down what time the different phases of the transition from day to night are expected (see table below)</li>
  <li>Set up tripod, set shot in focus (for stars - around infinite)</li>
  <li>Intervals set to between 20-40 secs</li>
  <li>Be ready to start shooting around 30-40 mins before sunset</li>
  <li>Start at ISO100</li>
  <li>Aim to keep exposure at 0ev until sunset</li>
  <li>Do this by adjusting shutter speed before starting to adjust ISO</li>
  <li>Then allow it to come up</li>
  <li>Will need most changes during twilight phases, lessen off, and then none once fully night</li>
  <li>As you get to the end of civil twiling and into nautical twilight (when its dark in one part of the sky but light in another…) ev can drift down to around -0.3 to -0.7</li>
  <li>Once you hit nautical twilight, will need to be adjusting every 2-3mins</li>
  <li>Once the Shutter speed hits (rule of 500/400) max for avoiding trailing, then start adjusting ISO</li>
</ul>

<p>Also need to work out the rule of 400/500 for the lens you’ll be using so you know how to avoid trailing (max shutter speed).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 500 rule is: max shutter speed = effective focal length / 500.</p>

  <p>I have a Canon R7 with a 1.6x crop factor, so my effective focal length (using a Skywatcher 200P/1000) is: 1.6*1000 = 1600.</p>

  <p>500 / 1600 = 0.3125 seconds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Equipped with this knowledge, I lined up the scope on the nebula, and swapped in the camera.  It was a little misty, so the stars were not quite as clear as last week, especially through the optics, but I was able to focus using a high exposure and ISO setting.  I then reduced the settings back down to 0.3 and ISO 6400 and took 160+ shots.  I did this using HDR+ mode (for faster shooting) and holding down the shoot button on the Canon Connect app so I could avoid touching the camera and introducing wobble.</p>

<p>My phone screen kept locking and in so doing, causing Canon Connect to disconnect, and by the time I got it all back connected everything needed realigning.  Increasing the delay on the lock screen to 5 mins was probably my biggest learning tonight!</p>

<p>The single images at ⅓ sec exposure were underwhelming, but with some basic processing came out looking pretty great (for a beginner!). When I was first out, I also took another batch of 150+ shots using ¼ sec exposures incase there was wobble in the first set, but didn’t end up processing them.</p>

<p>There are a lot of YouTube videos on how to stack and/or process your images, and I found most to either skip some steps or following them returned errors for me.  My goal was to figure out how to “simply” stack the images into one, and then how to balance the contrast/ brightness / colours to bring out the nebula.  In the end I found this video which made using Siril simple and effective: <a href="https://youtu.be/aruMYnfhrjw?si=cEkNyEi9WV5TV7C6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basic astro image stacking and processing with Siril</a></p>

<p>I initially used Siril to do the stacking, and then tried processing the stacked image separately in Siril and Photoshop.  I got more depth of colour in Photoshop, but I personally preferred the cleaner, more ethereal feel of the Siril edit.  I definitely have a huge way to go,  I feel I’m starting to understand the process now, and it’s really encouraging to have achieved these pictures, especially without use of a tracker.</p>

Lots to learn then!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First attempt at M42 Orion Nebula</title><link href="https://ashterism.com/2025/03/02/trying-orion.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First attempt at M42 Orion Nebula" /><published>2025-03-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ashterism.com/2025/03/02/trying-orion</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ashterism.com/2025/03/02/trying-orion.html"><![CDATA[<p>Short session last night, only tried a few shoots of M42 - Orion Nebula.  Decided to focus on this nebula for a while and try and use it to learn how to shoot nebulas and understand the processes involved before getting distracted by the idea of upgrading kit etc, so took some initial shoots to learn from.</p>

<p>Exposure time vs trailing going to be an issue.  Tried 3.2sec, 2.5secs, and 1 sec, and various ISOs.  Even 1 sec showed trailing, which isn’t ideal!  Even with trailing though, the images are awe-inspiring - you can actually see the clouds.</p>

<p>On a 2 sec exposure, iso25600 had the best detail, though iso12800 was still good:</p>

<p>Getting the focus right was also key (see below), but made difficult by even a tiny turn of the focus dials introducing a lot of shake, and then having to track the telescope back to centre once its stopped moving.  Helps me understand why people recommend upgrading the focus mechanism or investing in an autofocus (one day!).</p>

It seemed better, but I eventually realised it was still causing wobble so ended up moving the telescope onto the grass.  More successfully, I added a shortcut to my iphone to toggle on/off a red colour filter and turn white point off (make it less bright and red) - just in case I need to look anything up without impacting my night vision too much.</p>

<p>I took some better images of Venus, this time at 1/4000, 1/2000, 1/1000 at iso100.  I think best balance of clarity/brightness at 1/2000 I think, but will have to retry on solid ground.</p>

<p>Although I was out for sunset, Mercury and Saturn were just too low in the west for me to be able to see due to some trees in that direction.  Keen to look at Saturn when it’s higher in April though.  I tried to find Uranus, but without success.  I did some across the Pleiades though, which caught my attention for much of the evening.</p>

<p>I’m finding myself happily looking through the scope or just my binos more and more, with photography taking a bit of a back seat.  I can definitely see myself doing more of both - certainly in the warmer months when I’ve worked out how to sit and observe rather than stand (or contort myself around) the scope for long periods in the cold.</p>

<p>Pleiades shots weren’t great, and didn’t match up to what I could see in the scope.  I will try this again with the telescope on firmer ground though. I did particularly like this string of stars you can see in the image below, nestled into the Pleiades cluster</p>

  <figcaption>0.5 sec at iso6400 (any slower exposure had trails due to wobble)</figcaption>

<p>It was Jupiter that made me realise I had a serious wobble issue when I couldn’t get a clearer image than below left.  After moving the telescope onto the grass I got a better image, with the bands just starting to be visible.  This isn’t far off what I could see in the scope, though I suspect I can capture a lot better detail I learn and practice more.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I took some shots of Ursa Major and Minor together, then mostly played around with some light painting ideas - though one for another time.</p>

<p>We had a couple of deckchairs and some blankets, and though I had the telescope set up,  we mostly used our unaided eyes and binoculars to look up and enjoy the starscape.</p>

<p>It’s a really enjoyable way to spend an evening, chatting and taking in the amazing night skies (bortle 4).  I talked through want I’d been learning about the night skies, and how they will move about the garden as the seasons change.  Talking with my dad helped me realise I’d learnt quite a lot from what the stars actually are (how far away, what they are made of etc), and useful things like how to use the big dipper / orion to find other stars.</p>

<p>I didn’t keep a log, but from memory we looked at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Orion (and it’s stars)</li>
  <li>Orion nebula (through the telescope)</li>
  <li>Big dipper / Ursa Major</li>
  <li>Polaris</li>
  <li>Little Dipper /Ursa Minor(harder to find)</li>
  <li>Jupiter</li>
  <li>Mars</li>
  <li>Pleiades</li>
  <li>Caster</li>
  <li>Pollux
…and looked up and looked at some of the constellations</li>
</ul>

<p>It really is amazing how much more you can see with binoculars.  I was skeptical of all the comments on “how to get into astronomy” posts that you should start with a good pair of binoculars, but you absolutely should!</p>

<p>Nice to just sit, chat, and look at the stars..</p>]]></content><author><name>Musings by Ash</name></author><category term="astro" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night I sat in my dad’s garden with him and looked up at the sky.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Getting acquainted</title><link href="https://ashterism.com/2025/02/28/gettingAcquainted.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Getting acquainted" /><published>2025-02-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ashterism.com/2025/02/28/gettingAcquainted</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ashterism.com/2025/02/28/gettingAcquainted.html"><![CDATA[<p>In anticipation of the much talked about planetary alignment on the 28th (tonight!) I got out a few times this week to familiarise myself with the stars and the telescope.  I’ve started reading “Nightwatch”, which is excellently written for the newbie, and really feeding my sense of awe and wonder at the universe - and giving some helpful pointers to actually get started.</p>

<p>Key amongst these, is that you can start to learn to navigate the stars by just learning the Big Dipper and Orion - as these point to various other stars and constellations.</p>

<p>My mind is a bit blown by Orion nebula.  Just sat there in the middle of Orion literally generating stars…</p>

<p>Anyway, I took a few photos of Venus - with my Camera (Canon R7 with 100-400mm) and also through the Skywatcher 200p.  On review, I needed a much shorter shutter speed - I used 1/30th and above, but will try 1/250 and 1/1000 next time, sticking with a low iso.</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption>0.5 sec - way too over exposed.</figcaption>

  <img src="/assets/images/25_03/25_02_27_02.png" alt="Over exposured image of Venus" />
  <figcaption>1/30th - still over exposed.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Also took some pictures of Mars, Orion, and the Big Dipper / Ursa Major with the R7/ 16mm.  They came out better, but still some blurring as using longer exposures (15-30 secs).  Without a tracker you get the trails, so I will try 5,10,15 secs and some higher ISOs next time.</p>

  <figcaption>Big Dipper - 1*30sec  - not as bad, but still gives an “out of focus” appearance.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>However, getting better at actually getting the focus right (just back from actual infinite it seems), and did get a nice (slightly tweaked in lightroom) pic of the Big Dipper with trees in the foreground (perhaps more by accident than design!).  I think I need to worry less about the pictures looking too dark ‘in the field’ and lean into post-processing to balance lighting etc.  Even when images look great on my high-res laptop screen, they need brightening for posting online or sharing with friends etc anyway.</p>

<p>Next time I’m out going to try some of the planets again, and also the same Orion/Big Dipper asterims to try and lock in the settings, and help me with remembering their utility as signposts.</p>]]></content><author><name>Musings by Ash</name></author><category term="astro" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In anticipation of the much talked about planetary alignment on the 28th (tonight!)
